# ContactsWebApp

A simple web application (React.js + .NET 5) where user can create an account, login and add, update and delete contacts.

.NET part was coded with best practices in mind:
- Three layer architecture.
- Dependency injection.
- Repository pattern.
- DTOs to transfer data.
- User authentication with JWT token.
- Entity framework core.

React.js part was created from separate and reusable components.
